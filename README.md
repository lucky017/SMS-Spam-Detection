# SMS Spam Detection
## Description
A machine learning-based SMS Spam Detector that classifies messages as spam or ham (not spam) with high accuracy. This project leverages Machine Learning techniques to analyze text messages and predict whether they are genuine(ham or non-spam) or spam. Î¤he experimental results confirm that the proposed system can achieve remarkable results in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Data Set Information  
The Dataset contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged according being ham (legitimate) or spam. The SMS Spam Collection v.1 (csv file: `spam-checkpoint.csv`)  has a total of 4,827 SMS legitimate messages (86.6%) and a total of 747 (13.4%) spam messages.

## Installation

https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install.html#id3

## How to use?
1. Open the terminal/conda
2. Type `git clone https://github.com/lucky017/SMS-Spam-Detection.git` to clone the repository to your local machine
3. Type `jupyter notebook`
4. From SMS-Spam-Detection/src/ folder select the SMS Spam Detection Analysis - NLP.ipynb file
5. Run it

## Results
The trained model achieved an accuracy of 97 % and Precision is 99 % on the test set and performed well in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score using Logistic Regression.
